            <h2>Welcome to Ambient Garden</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Celestial Soundworks! This site was created because of my love for sound design, specifically in the ambient genre. Interested in learning about ambient sound design? This is the perfect site for you.

            <h2>What Is Sound Design?</h2>
            <p>
                When starting sound design, it may seem complex at first. When looking at a synthesizer for the first time, there are lots of different areas that may confuse someone at first, but each area is actually very simple. There are wavetables, which allow a person to choose a waveform to start creating the sound that they are looking for. Then, there is an ADSR table, which lets someone change the attack, decay, sustain, and release of their sound. After that there are filters, effects, and modulation, which take time to learn, but become second nature after practicing your sound design.

            <h2>What is Ambient Music?</h2>
            <p>
                Ambient music is best known for the feeling it gives to the listener. Whether that be calming, or even gloomy, ambient music will relay what feelings the musician wanted to display to the listener. Ambient music takes control of space and atmosphere better than any other genre, and sound designers use this to make more impactful sounds.
            </p>

            <h2>Influences and Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Many ambient artists have helped shape the way that I view ambient music, as well as influencing my sound design and production of ambient music. Brian Eno is my favorite. His music speaks to me in a way that no other ambient musician does. His sound is calming and peaceful, which has a lot to do with the way he crafts his sounds and the way he uses his production techniques. Aphex Twin is a good example of someone who has pushed boundaries in ambient music, combining many different genres, as well as adding drums and rhythm to his ambient works. Other artists that have inspired me are Father2006 and Reverie.
