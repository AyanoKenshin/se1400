            <h2>Welcome to Ambient Garden</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to Ambient Garden, a home for ambient sound design, creativity, and musical exploration. This website is designed for anyone interested in learning how atmospheric sounds are created and for those who want to explore ambient presets crafted in Serum 2. Ambient sound design focuses on creating spacious, emotional textures that support calm, cinematic, or meditative music, and this site serves as a guide for understanding that process.

            <h2>What Is Sound Design?</h2>
            <p>
                Sound design is the art of shaping audio from the ground up using different waveforms, filters, modulation tools, and effects. Rather than relying solely on pre-made samples, sound designers create pads, drones, tones, and textures that feel expressive and unique. In ambient music specifically, sound design plays an essential role in crafting evolving layers that define the genre. Long attacks, soft filters, deep reverbs, and creative delays help transform simple waveforms into rich soundscapes.
            </p>

            <h2>What is Ambient Music?</h2>
            <p>
                Ambient music is known for its focus on tone and atmosphere rather than rhythm. Producers often use extended chords, slow textures, and minimal percussion to build immersive sound environments. Many listeners appreciate ambient music for its emotional depth and its ability to create a sense of movement or space. Because of this, ambient producers depend heavily on thoughtful sound design.
            </p>

            <h2>Influences and Inspiration</h2>
            <p>
                Some of the most influential ambient creators have shaped the way modern producers approach sound. Artists such as Brian Eno, Oneheart, Burial, and various cinematic composers have inspired countless techniques for building atmospheric pads and textures. Their work shows how powerful sound design can be when used to support emotion rather than speed or intensity.
