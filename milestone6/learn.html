            <h2>Learn Ambient Sound Design</h2>
            <p>
                Ambient sound design comes in all forms. Whether you want your track to sound calming, or whether you want it to sound dark and gritty. When you get a DAW (FL Studio, Ableton, etc.), the stock plugins and effects aren’t typically designed for ambient music, and make it hard to create the sound that you are looking for. This page displays some of the tools that can help create your dream sound.

            <h2>Choosing the Right Synthesizers</h2>
            <p>
                The two synthesizers that I use most to create my sounds are <a href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum-2"><strong>Serum 2</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/pigments/overview"><strong>Pigments</strong></a>. These two synthesizers have been essential for me in my process of creating ambient music, as well as many other genres. Serum 2 offers a simplistic design that makes it easier when learning how to sound design. Pigments is perfectly made for ambient, and has a large collection of presets and wavetables for a sound designer to use.

            <h2>Essential Ambient Effects</h2>
            <p>
                Good sound design is not complete without effects. Effects such as reverb and delay help bring a sound to life by adding more space and echo to the sound. Two of my favorites are <a href="https://valhalladsp.com/shop/reverb/valhalla-supermassive/"><strong>Valhalla Supermassive</strong></a> and <a href="https://output.com/products/portal"><strong>Portal</strong></a>. Supermassive, like the name suggests, helps turn a simple sound into a wide, atmospheric sound. Portal has a wide variety of uses, and can help turn your sound into something extremely unique.
            </p>

            <h2>Experiment and Explore</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest rule to sound design is to have fun! It’s a tough learning process to be able to create exactly what you want, but through hard work, anyone can do it. Learn what every button and knob can do to your sound, and start to develop your own personal sound.
