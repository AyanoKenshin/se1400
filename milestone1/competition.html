        <h4>What they are doing right:</h4>
        <p>Content Layout: Making the theme of the website match the content they are presenting</p>
        
        <h4>What they are doing wrong:</h4>
        <p>Focusing on selling what they create more than providing information on sound design.</p>
        <p>Hiding parts of the process of sound design.</p>

        <h4>How my site will be better:</h4>
        <p>Will inform people and get people excited about sound design without having to hide or "gatekeep" information from people who are just trying to learn.</p>
        <p>I will go in depth about what programs should be used and how literally ANYONE can start sound designing right now.</p>
