        <h2>Website Summary:</h2>

        <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
        <p>AstroScape will contain images and information about sound design, specifically space ambient sound design. </p>

        <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site?</h4>
        <p>Almost all of it will be screenshots or videos that I will take myself of my own sound design and the information provided will be from what I have learned in over four years of practicing sound design.</p>

        <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
        <p>If somebody is interested in sound design, they should care about my site because the content is informative and I will showcase it in a fun and simple way.</p>

        <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
        <p>Two reasons. Sound design is hard and takes a lot of practice and learning to get to understand it. A site like this can also be used to sell sounds that I have designed and sell them in a folder all together after providing information about sound design.</p>

        <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
        <p>Learn and get excited about sound design.</p>

        <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
        <p>To show people what sound design is and even teach them about it.</p>
